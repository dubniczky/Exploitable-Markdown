# Exploitable Markdown

Exploitable web-based markdown to pdf converter

## Details

Markdown is a text-centric markup format, aimed to provide a quick and low-overhead way to format documents. Markdown natively supports embedded HTML tags, which sometimes include script tags. Converting unsanitized markdown is thus unsafe in a server context because of the possibility of remote code execution.

This project is an example of an exploitable server.
